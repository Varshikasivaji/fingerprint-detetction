CNN-based fingerprint image processing system for blood group classification
# Enhanced AI-Based Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprints

## Abstract
This project proposes a novel method to predict an individual’s blood group from fingerprint patterns using advanced image and signal processing techniques. High-resolution fingerprint images are captured and processed through histogram equalization, noise removal, ridge enhancement, and feature extraction. The extracted features are analyzed and classified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ResNet architecture.  
The primary objective of the system is to provide a **non-invasive, rapid, and cost-effective alternative** to conventional blood group detection by identifying unique correlations between fingerprint characteristics and blood groups.

##  Methodology / Proposed System
###  **1. Data Acquisition**
High-resolution fingerprint images are collected through scanners or mobile-based fingerprint capture systems.

###  **2. Preprocessing**
- Grayscale conversion  
- Histogram Equalization  
- Gaussian/Median Noise Filtering  
- Ridge & Edge Enhancement  
- Image Normalization  
- ROI detection & cropping  

###  **3. Feature Extraction**
- Minutiae Analysis  
- Ridge Orientation & Frequency  
- Texture Features  
- Gabor / Sobel / Canny filters  
- Deep feature extraction using pre-trained **ResNet**

###  **4. Classification**
A hybrid CNN–ResNet model is used:
- CNN for spatial fingerprint feature extraction  
- ResNet layers for deeper pattern learning  
- Softmax output for blood group prediction (A, B, AB, O, Rh±)

###  **5. Output**
Predicted blood group is displayed along with confidence score.
